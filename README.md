# DWM Bar for OpenRC

This script provides a simple status bar for [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/) users running OpenRC as their init system. It displays various system information such as network status, weather, system uptime, CPU usage, and battery status.

Note: Some of the code for this script was generated by [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatting-with-ai/), a language model developed by OpenAI.
## Requirements

This script requires the following programs to be installed:
* [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/)
* [xsetroot](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/man/man1/xsetroot.1.xhtml)
* [NetworkManager](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/NetworkManager) (or another network management tool that provides the nmcli command)
* [amixer](https://linux.die.net/man/1/amixer)
* [curl](https://curl.se/)
* [bc](https://www.gnu.org/software/bc/)
* [acpi](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/ACPI)
* [wmname](https://packages.gentoo.org/packages/x11-misc/wmname)

## Installation
### dwm

You can download the latest version of dwm from the official website. After downloading the source code, extract the archive and run the following commands:

```shell
$ cd dwm-*
$ sudo make clean install
```

This will compile and install dwm on your system.
### xsetroot

xsetroot is part of the X Window System, which is likely already installed on your system if you are running a graphical desktop environment. If not, you can install it using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Gentoo-based systems you can run:

```csharp
$ sudo emerge --ask x11-apps/xsetroot
```

### Other Dependencies

You can install the remaining dependencies using your distribution's package manager. For example, on Gentoo-based systems you can run:

```csharp
$ sudo emerge --ask net-misc/networkmanager net-misc/curl sys-devel/bc sys-power/acpi x11-misc/wmname
$ USE="alsa" sudo emerge --ask media-sound/pulseaudio 
```

## Usage

To use the script, simply copy and paste the code into a new file named dwm_bar.sh. Then make the file executable with the command:

```shell
$ chmod +x dwm_bar.sh
```

Finally, add the following line to your .xinitrc or .xsession file (located in your home directory):

```shell
$ ./dwm_bar.sh &
```

This will start the script in the background when you start dwm. The status bar will appear at the top of the screen.
### Customization

You can modify the script to suit your needs by changing the system information that is displayed in the status bar. The comments in the code indicate which sections correspond to each piece of information.

You can also change the format of the status bar by editing the xsetroot command near the end of the script. Be careful not to remove any of the necessary spacing or separator characters.
